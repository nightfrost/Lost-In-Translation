# Lost in Translation app

A front-end text to sign language app, built with ReactJS, that allows the user to login and translate text to sign language.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/nightfrost/Lost-In-Translation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the server: `npm start`
4. Navigate to localhost: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Heroku

The application is hosted at: https://lost-in-translation-dk.herokuapp.com/ <br>
The Heroku dyno sleeps after 30 mins of inactivity, so your first visit might take longer while it starts up. [`create-react-app-buildpack`](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) was used to deply the application.
